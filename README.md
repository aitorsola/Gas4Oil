This is the Gas4Oil source code iOS app.

Gas4Oil is an app that shows near fuel stations. You can sort stations by distance, price up or price down. Get directions to selected station.

Also you can get fuel stations by province or municipality and make favorite the stations you like. 

Save your car brand and model for obtaining the exact price for filling the tank up

The app is entirely developed using SwiftUI in MVVM architecture. I've used SPM (Swift Package Manager) for Lottie, Notificationbanner and Swiftui-shimmer libraries.
